While this method is limited in terms of what you should contribute, you can still contribute to the project by adding new text content on existing pages, fixing typos, or improving existing text content.

### Requirements 

- Good understanding of [Markdown](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/)

2. Navigate to the file you want to edit in the GitHub repository of your fork.

3. Click on the edit icon on the top right corner of the file.

4. Make your changes in the editor.

5. After making changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page and write a short description of the changes you made.

6. Create a pull request to the main repository. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request.

7. Celebrate when your pull request is merged!

</Steps>

## IDE-based Contribution

This method is more advanced and allows you to contribute to the project in a more flexible way. You can add new pages, edit existing pages, and add new components to the Hub. 
This also allows you to preview your changes locally before submitting a pull request.

### Requirements 

- Basic understanding of [Markdown](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/) and [Starlight Components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/)
- Basic understanding of how to use GitHub
- A brain and patience
- A computer and an internet connection
- A code editor like VSCode or a GitHub's Codespace

### Setting up the project


<Steps>

1. Fork the project, then clone it to your local machine. If you don't know what any of this means then refer to this [video here](https://youtu.be/CML6vfKjQss?t=106).

2. Install any package manager you want to use. We recommend pnpm due to it's performant and small size. 
   You can install pnpm by visiting the [official website](https://pnpm.io/installation) and following the instructions. You will also need to install a JavaScript runtime      environment called Node.js which can be done via [this website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).


3. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Run the project by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to see the project running.

6. After making changes, make sure you're not breaking anything by previewing your changes locally.
   If there are no errors, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

7. Create a pull request to the main repository. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request.

8. Celebrate when your pull request is merged!

</Steps>
