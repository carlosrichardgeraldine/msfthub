You can find the Dashboard here: [Certification Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/users/me/credentials?tab=credentials-tab&WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290).

## Upcoming Exam Appointment

Here you can see all your scheduled appointments. As of this January, you can only have 2 exams scheduled at the same time. You can directly access PearsonVUE portal from here by clicking the **Reschedule** button.

## Certifications

Here you can access all your certifications, share them around, download them, see when they expire and if you are in the renewal window.

## Past Exams

Similarly, to the **Certifications** section, you can find all your exams here. One added bonus is that this is another place you can directly access PearsonVUE portal from by choosing the **View details on provider site**.

Here you can access all your assessment attempts. So, if you fail you can check which areas were you weaker in and study up on those more.

## Microsoft Certification Moderated Support Forum

And lastly, you can see [Microsoft certification support](https://trainingsupport.microsoft.com/mcp/forum) URL. This is really important since Microsoft certification support is the **only** place where you can solve certification and profile issues or try to get exams refunded/rescheduled after PearsonVUE messes your exam up and you lose the exam attempt.

Usually contacting PearsonVUE themselves is a huge waste of time. So, this is the best option.

## PearsonVUE Portal

Besides Certification Dashboard, you can also access PearsonVUE Portal using this URL [PearsonVUE Portal](https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/registration/Dashboard/MICROSOFT)

When you are in PearsonVUE portal, you can navigate to the main page by clicking the **PearsonVUE Home button.**

The most important thing here, besides being able to see all upcoming exams and reschedule them, you can access your past exam score reports. The option is located under **My account** \> **View score reports** on the right side of the page.
